## Additional Information

The naming of this packet and the usage of other `Myroom` packets implies this may have been used allow players to switch their jobs while in another players mog house, or to be able to view the other players unlocked jobs and job levels.

The client does not actually make use of this packet or its data in any manner. While the client does have a handler for this packet, the manner in which it works causes the packet to be ignored. It checks to see if a callback function has been set to handle the packet data, if not it simply exits. The callback function pointer used with this handler is never set, thus, the packet data is never used.
