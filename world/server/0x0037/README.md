## Status Effects (`BufStatus` & `BufStatusBits`)

The `BufStatus` and `BufStatusBits` values are both used to calculate the full proper status effect ids that are currently affecting the client. Originally, the game only required `BufStatus` to hold these values, but as the game has developed over time, the id of status effects has grown beyond the `255` value limit that a `uint8_t` can hold. Due to this, a change was required to be able to support these higher value ids.

Based on how packet changes happen over time, it is assumed that SE generally chooses to add onto packets vs. editing any of their base fields to potentially be backward-compatible with older clients _(allows for easy-rollbacks if needed)_ unless the packet (or the system it relates to) is being fully overhauled. Due to this, the manner in which they have added support for higher value status ids is by adding a new `uint64_t` value that holds the high-value masking bits for each status effect. The `BufStatusBits` value is used for this purpose, in which each of the 32 status effects has 2 bits in this value dedicated to it to extend its value beyond `255`.

The client recalculates the proper status effect ids in the following manner:

```cpp
for (auto x = 0; x < 32; ++x)
{
    if (pkt->BufStatus[x] != 0xFF || (((uint8_t*)&pkt->BufStatusBits + (x >> 0x02)) >> (0x02 * (x % 0x04)) & 0x03) != 0)
    {
        // Recalculate the full status effect id..
        PTR_status_data.Buffs[x] = pkt->BufStatus[x] | (((uint8_t*)&pkt->BufStatusBits + (x >> 0x02)) >> (0x02 * (x % 0x04))) & 0x03;
    }
    else
    {
        // No status effect for this slot..
        PTR_status_data.Buffs[x] = -1;
    }
}
```

_The `status_bits_t` structure shows how this can be directly accessed using bits as well instead of manually doing the math above._

## Flags: `flags0_t`

### `HideFlag`

_Unknown._

When this flag is set, it will cause the local player entity to be hidden. It also disables/hides various UI elements such as the status effect icons, clock, location, entity dots on the compass. It will also close open menus and deselect the current target.

### `SleepFlag`

_Unknown._

When this flag is set, it will cause the local player entity to be hidden. It also disables/hides various UI elements such as the status effect icons, clock, location, entity dots on the compass. It will also close open menus and deselect the current target.

### `GroundFlag`

_Flag set if the entity should ignore world collision._

When this flag is set, the client entity can walk through walls. It will still collide with other entities.

### `CliPosInitFlag`

_Unknown._

This flag appears to be used to determine if the client entity is ready for rendering and movement. It is used in a check to determine if the entity model should be hidden from rendering.

### `LfgFlag`

_Flag set if the entity is looking for party._

When this flag is set, it will change the entities name icon to the black and green seeking party flag.

### `AnonymousFlag`

_Flag set if the entity is anonymous. (/anon)_

When this flag is set, it will change the entities name color to dark blue denoting they are hiding their job information.

### `CfhFlag`

_Flag set if the entity is marked as 'called for help'._

When this flag is set, it will change the entities name color to orange.

### `AwayFlag`

_Flag set if the entity if away. (/away - POL status.)_

When this flag is set, it will change the entities name icon to the blue and white circle. This flag also represents that the entity is currently away on their PlayOnline friends list.

### `Gender`

_The entities gender._

This value is used to set the entities gender. This is used during events when addressing the entity as "sir", "ma'am", or similar.

  - `0` = Female
  - `1` = Male

### `unknown_1_9`

_Flag set if the entity is within a zone-wide treasure pool area or party._

If this flag is set, it will cause the entities `ZoneNo` field to be set with the current `pGlobalNowZone->ZoneNo` value. The client uses this value to determine if the client is within a zone-wide based treasure pool area or party. When set, it will cause the client to display the extended treasure pool window.

### `unknown_1_10`

_Unknown._

This value is used with the main `GC_ZONE` object. _(It is assumed that this is the new `MonStat` value that was used in this packet previously.)_

### `GraphSize`

_The entities model size._

  - `0` = Small
  - `1` = Medium
  - `2` = Large

### `Chocobo_Index`

_Unknown._

This value is used when the entity is mounted. It appears to be used as an animation lookup index in regards to which mounting model animation is played. This is generally seen as being set to `1` when on a chocobo.

### `hpp`

_The entities current health percent._

### `PlayOnelineFlag`

_Flag set if the entity is logged out to PlayOnline._

When this flag is set, it will change the entities name icon to the blue PlayOnline icon. This feature was removed from the game in 2006. However, the icon still exists and this flag still works.

### `LinkShellFlag`

_Flag set if the entity is wearing a linkshell item. (ie. Pearl, Sack, Shell)_

When this flag is set, it will display a linkshell next to the players name. _(Other icons have higher priority to be shown first.)_

### `LinkDeadFlag`

_Flag set if the entity is disconnecting / timing out._

When this flag is set, it will change the entities name icon to the red disconnection circle. _(Also known as 'R0' in the community.)_

### `TargetOffFlag`

_Flag set if the entity should not be targetable._

When this flag is set, the entity cannot be targeted by normal means.

### `unknown_3_28`

_Unknown._

### `GmLevel`

_The entities GM level._

This value can be used to show a number of icons, however the client only uses values `>= 3` to determine GM level. When this value is set, it will also change the entities name icon to one of the following:

  - `0` = None
  - `1` = Trial Account Icon (Green/Yellow Arrow)
  - `2` = Trial Account Icon (Green/Yellow Arrow)
  - `3` = PlayOnline Icon
  - `4` = GM Icon (Red GM icon.)
  - `5` = GM Icon (Red GM icon.)
  - `6` = GM Icon (Red GM icon.)
  - `7` = GM Icon (SquareEnix GM icon.)

## Flags: `flags1_t`

### `Speed`

_The entities movement speed._

This value is calculated as: `entity->MovementSpeed2 = pkt->Flags1.Speed * 0.1;`

### `Hackmove`

_Flag set if the entity should ignore world collision._

When this flag is set, the client entity can walk through walls. It will still collide with other entities.

### `FreezeFlag`

_Flag set if the client is locked in place._

When this flag is set, it locks the client entity in place and removes the compass.

### `unknown_1_14`

_Unknown._

This flag is previously known as `GMInvisFlag` on the PS2 beta.

### `InvisFlag`

_Flag set if the entity is invisible._

### `GateBreachFlg`

_Flag set if the entity has Gate Breach status during Ballista._

This flag is used during Ballista to mark the player as having Gate Breach status. _(Shows the star icon on the scoreboard.)_

### `SpeedBase`

_The entities animation speed._

This value is calculated as: `entity->AnimationSpeed = pkt->Flags1.SpeedBase * 0.1;`

### `unknown_3_25`

_Unknown._

The bits of this value used to be part of the `SpeedBase` value, but are no longer used.

### `BazaarFlag`

_Flag set if the entity has a bazaar available._

When this flag is set, it will change the entities name icon to the brown bag icon.

### `CharmFlag`

_Flag set if the entity is charmed._

### `GmIconFlag`

_Flag set if the entity is a GM but is hiding their icon._

When this flag is set, the GM icon will be hidden allowing another flags icon, or none, to be shown instead.

## Flags: `flags2_t`

### `NamedFlag`

_Flag set if the entity is named._

When this flag is set, it will cause any mentions of this entities name to no longer be prefixed with `The`. Most notorious monsters will have this set.

### `SingleFlag`

_Flag set if the entity should be referred to plurally._

When this flag is set, it will cause any references to this entity to be considered plural. For example, when checking an entity it will change the message wording such as `seem` vs. `seems`.

### `AutoPartyFlag`

_Flag set if the entity is auto-seeking a party._

When this flag is set, it will change the entities name icon to the red party seeking icon.

### `PetIndex`

_The entities pet target index._

### `MotStopFlag`

_Flag set if the entities motion scheduler should be paused._

This flag is used when the entity is petrified or terrorized. It will cause the entity to pause their current animation and freeze in place. _(Additional flags are set to lock the entity in place.)_

### `CliPriorityFlag`

_Flag set if the entity is considered priority._

When this flag is set, it will override the internal limit when rendering entities to screen. Usually the client will loop through the entity array and draw each valid entity until a limit is reached. This flag will allow the entity to be drawn regardless of this limit being reached each frame.

### `BallistaFlg`

_The entities ballista information._

The client uses this as the clients Ballista flags.
