## Description

This packet is sent by the server to respond to a client login request (`0x000A`).

The client uses the information from this response to initialize the current `GC_ZONE` instance, preparing it for usage when the zone is initialized and loaded.

## Packet Layout

The layout of this packet is the following:

## Packet Fields

The following information describes the structures outlined above.

## Structure Fields (`GP_SERV_LOGIN`)

### `id`, `size`, `sync`

_These fields are part of the packet header._

_You can find more information about the header fields here: [**Header**](/world/HEADER.md)_

### `PosHead`

_Sub-structure containing general update information about the local client._

_See structure field breakdown below for more information._

### `ZoneNo`

_The zone number._

### `ntTime`

_The time system time value in seconds._

### `ntTimeSec`

_The time system count value._

### `GameTime`

_The game time value._

### `EventNo`

_The event no value._

This value is used with `EventNum` to determine which event data to be loaded.

### `MapNumber`

_The map number._

This value will generally match the `ZoneNo` value for most zones.

### `GrapIDTbl`

_The clients equipment model visual ids._

  - `GrapIDTbl[0]` - _The clients race and hair ids._
  - `GrapIDTbl[1]` - _The clients head equipment visual model id._
  - `GrapIDTbl[2]` - _The clients body equipment visual model id._
  - `GrapIDTbl[3]` - _The clients hands equipment visual model id._
  - `GrapIDTbl[4]` - _The clients legs equipment visual model id._
  - `GrapIDTbl[5]` - _The clients feet equipment visual model id._
  - `GrapIDTbl[6]` - _The clients main equipment visual model id._
  - `GrapIDTbl[7]` - _The clients sub equipment visual model id._
  - `GrapIDTbl[8]` - _The clients ranged equipment visual model id._

### `MusicNum`

_The array of music values to be used for the various purposes within the zone._

  - `MusicNum[0]` - _Zone Music: Day_
  - `MusicNum[1]` - _Zone Music: Night_
  - `MusicNum[2]` - _Battle Music: Solo_
  - `MusicNum[3]` - _Battle Music: Party_
  - `MusicNum[4]` - _Mount Music_

### `SubMapNumber`

_The sub map number._

This value represents the inner-region within a zone that the player is located within. If the zone does not have sub-regions, then this value will generally be 0. These regions can be used to separate the client from within common reused events such as airships. _(For example, the airship counters/rooms/docks in Port Jeuno are each separate regions.)_

### `EventNum`

_The event num value._

This value is used with `EvetNo` to determine which event data to be loaded.

### `EventPara`

_The event para value._

This value is used as the event id to determine which event opcode block to execute.

### `EventMode`

_The event mode._

This value is used as a set of flags for the event system.

### `WeatherNumber`, `WeatherNumber2`, `WeatherTime`, `WeatherTime2`, `WeatherOffsetTime`

_The zone weather values._

When the client is initializing the zone (`FUNC_ZoneSetUp`) it will make use of these values to prepare the zones time and weather related functionality. The client will initialize the zone in the following manner with these values:

```cpp
XiDateTime dt_real_frame{}; // Initializes time values to 0..
XiDateTime dt_frame{};      // Initializes time values to 0..

PTR_WeatherStartTime    = PTR_pGlobalNowZone->WeatherTime2;
PTR_WeatherNumber       = PTR_pGlobalNowZone->WeatherNumber2;
PTR_WeatherOffsetTime   = HIWORD(PTR_pGlobalNowZone->WeatherOffsetTime);

FUNC_XiDateTime_SetTickRealFrame(&dt_real_frame, 60 * PTR_WeatherStartTime);
FUNC_XiDateTime_SetTickFrame(&dt_frame, 3600 * PTR_WeatherOffsetTime);

auto wid = FUNC_Helper_GetWeatherResId(PTR_Zone, PTR_WeatherNumber);
FUNC_XiArea_SetWeather(PTR_Zone, wid, dt_real_frame, dt_frame);

dt_real_frame   = XiDateTime(0); // Initializes time values to 0..
dt_frame        = XiDateTime(0); // Initializes time values to 0..

PTR_WeatherStartTime    = PTR_pGlobalNowZone->WeatherTime;
PTR_WeatherNumber       = PTR_pGlobalNowZone->WeatherNumber;
PTR_WeatherOffsetTime   = PTR_pGlobalNowZone->WeatherOffsetTime;

auto wid = FUNC_Helper_GetWeatherResId(PTR_Zone, PTR_WeatherNumber);
FUNC_XiArea_SetWeather(PTR_Zone, wid, dt_real_frame, dt_frame);
```

### `ShipStart`, `ShipEnd`

_The ship start and end time values to initialize the ship system with._

When the client is initializing the zone (`FUNC_ZoneSetUp`) it will make use of these values to prepare the zones ship system. The values for this are used as follows:

```cpp
if (PTR_pGlobalNowZone->ShipStart)
{
    if (PTR_pGlobalNowZone->ShipEnd)
    {
        if (PTR_pGlobalNowZone->ZoneFlags & 0x20)
            FUNC_ShipInitReverse(PTR_pGlobalNowZone->ShipStart, PTR_pGlobalNowZone->ShipEnd, HIBYTE(PTR_pGlobalNowZone->ZoneFlags4));
        else
            FUNC_ShipInit(PTR_pGlobalNowZone->ShipStart, PTR_pGlobalNowZone->ShipEnd, HIBYTE(PTR_pGlobalNowZone->ZoneFlags4));
    }
}
```

The `FUNC_ShipInit` and `FUNC_ShipInitReverse` functions take the given timing values and prepares the ship time in the following manner:

```cpp
void __cdecl FUNC_ShipInit(int32_t ship_start, int32_t ship_end, int32_t path_num)
{
    PTR_ship_path_number    = path_num;
    PTR_reverse_flag        = 0; // Set to 1 if calling `FUNC_ShipInitReverse`.

    const auto val1 = 60.0 * (ship_end - ship_start);
    const auto val2 = FUNC_ntGameTimeGet() - ship_start;

    PTR_ship_v = 1.0 / val1;
    PTR_ship_t = val2 * 60.0 / val1;
}
```

### `IsMonstrosity`

_Flag that states if Monstrosity is active._

### `LoginState`

_The clients login state._

### `name`

_The clients character name._

### `certificate`

_The clients certificate values._

These values are unique to the current client. The client sends these values back to the server with every packet. _(Part of the `0x001C` bytes of header data with each packet.)_ These values **MUST** match what the client was last sent from the server, otherwise it will be disconnected from the server. The server checks this value constantly and will begin to R0 the client as soon as its invalid.

> [!NOTE]
> The manner in which these values are generated or are connected to the client are unknown at this time. It may just be completely random, or it may be connected to other values in some manner.

### `unknown9C`

_The purpose of this value is unknown._

The client stores this value in the main `GC_ZONE` instance, but never uses it afterward. It has been observed to match the value sent as `ZoneSubNo` or usually set to `0`.

### `ZoneSubNo`

_The zone sub number value._

This value is used for zones that are instanced or have multiple inner maps in the same area. For example, the battle content Sortie makes use of several zones that contain sub-areas using this value. To load the client into the area `Outer Ra'Kaznar [U2]` for Sortie, the client would set:

  - `ZoneNo` to `133`
  - `MapNumber` to `133`
  - `ZoneSubNo` to `1031`

_The client uses this value when calculating what DAT files to be loaded for the zone._

### `PlayTime`

_The clients play time offset value._

The client calculates the value to be used when displaying the playtime as:

```cpp
bool __cdecl FUNC_gcZonePlayTimeGet(uint32_t *ptime)
{
    if (!PTR_pGlobalNowZone)
        return false;
    *ptime = PTR_pGlobalNowZone->PlaySys.PlayTime - PTR_pGlobalNowZone->PlaySys.LoginTime + FUNC_ntGameTimeGet();
    return true;
}
```

### `DeadCounter`

_The client death counter value._

The client calculates and stores this value as:

```cpp
zone->DeadCounter = pkt->DeadCounter / 60 + FUNC_ntGameTimeGet();
```

### `MyroomSubMapNumber`

_The clients mog house sub map number._

The client calculates and stores this value as:

```cpp
zone->MyroomSubMapNumber = (pkt->MyroomSubMapNumber >> 1) & 3;
```

_The client uses this value in various checks to determine if you are allowed to place/move furniture, which kind of exit menu is displayed, etc._

### `unknownA9`

_The purpose of this value is unknown._

The client stores this value in the main `GC_ZONE` instance, but never uses it afterward.

### `MyroomMapNumber`

_The clients mog house map number._

This value represents the model id of the area to be loaded for the players mog house. The value will vary based on some additional circumstances. For example, if the player has their mog house registered to one of the main three nations, then the value will change based on if they are aligned to that nation or if they are a guest.

| Nation | Home | Guest |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| `San d'Oria`  | `0x0121` | `0x0101` |
| `Bastok`      | `0x0122` | `0x0102` |
| `Windurst`    | `0x0123` | `0x0120` |

Further, the value will differ if the player is accessing the second floor of their house.

| Nation | Value |
| ---: | --- |
| `San d'Oria`  | `0x0267` |
| `Bastok`      | `0x0268` |
| `Windurst`    | `0x0269` |
| `Patio`       | `0x026A` |

Additional locations for residence include:

| Zone | Value |
| ---: | --- |
| `Aht Urhgan (Whitegate)`  | `0x00D6` |
| `Ronfaure Front`          | `0x00BD` |
| `Gustaberg Front`         | `0x00C7` |
| `Sarutabaruta Front`      | `0x00DB` |
| `Jeuno`                   | `0x0100` |
| `Adoulin`                 | `0x0124` |
| `Mog Garden`              | `0x02D4` |
| `Feretory`                | `0x02D9` |

### `SendCount`

_Entity (NPC) load count limiter value._

The server can use this value to lock the client in place and prevent movement upon first entering a zone. This value represents the number of flagged NPC entities _(referred to as `king`)_ that must load _(via `0x000E` packets sent from the server)_ before the client is allowed to move. When the client is put into this state, rendering additional entities is paused and allows for all needed entities to populate. _(This is generally used to allow on-zone-in cutscenes to load their needed entities data first before playing the cutscene.)_

In the event the client fails to load the expected `SendCount` number of entities, the client has a built-in timeout as a failsafe when put into this mode. If the client does not reach the expected count within `6` seconds, it will be released and the event will play regardless.

### `MyRoomExitBit`

_Value that controls the exit menu type when leaving the mog house._

The naming of this variable has likely changed since PS2 beta as it no longer is treated as a single bit flag. Instead, it is now a value _(ranging from `0` to `9`)_ which determines the kind of menu that will be displayed when leaving each of the various residential areas of the game.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | _Default; display normal exit menu._ |
| `1` | _Enables extended exit menu when leaving `San d'Oria` residence._ |
| `2` | _Enables extended exit menu when leaving `Bastok` residence._ |
| `3` | _Enables extended exit menu when leaving `Windurst` residence._ |
| `4` | _Enables extended exit menu when leaving `Jeuno` residence._ |
| `5` | _Enables extended exit menu when leaving `Aht Urhgan (Whitegate)` residence_ |
| `6` | _Enables extended exit menu when leaving `Ronfaure Front` residence._ |
| `7` | _Enables extended exit menu when leaving `Gustaberg Front` residence._ |
| `8` | _Enables extended exit menu when leaving `Sarutabaruta Front` residence._ |
| `9` | _Enables extended exit menu when leaving `Adoulin` residence._ |

### `MogZoneFlag`

_Flag that states if the current zone has access to the mog menu._

This flag is set in areas that have nomad Moogles.

### `Dancer`

_Sub-structure containing general update information about the local clients character._

_See structure field breakdown below for more information._

### `ConfData`

_Sub-structure containing client configuration data._

_See structure field breakdown below for more information._

### `Ex`

_The purpose of this value is unknown._

This array of data holds the clients server-side savable configurations. This includes things like:

  - Current party seeking flag.
  - Current away status.
  - Current language.
  - Current auto-target setting.
  - Current message filter settings.
  - etc.

Based on the PS2 exported data:

  - `unknown00[0]` - _Holds various bit flags and bit data for invite flag, away flag, anon flag, language, GM level, auto-target, etc.._
  - `unknown00[1]` - _Chat filter bits._
  - `unknown00[2]` - _Chat filter bits._

## Additional Information

The `GP_MYROOM_DANCER_PKT` and `SAVE_CONF_PKT` structures are postfixed with the `_PKT` naming as these do not align to the actual internal structures that share the same name. This packet has changed since the PS2 beta and does not directly align to the non-packet variants of the same named structures. Instead, they are only partial copies from the packet into memory.
