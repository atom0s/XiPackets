## Additional Information

When the client first talks to the world pass vendor, they will be prompted with a menu that allows them to choose between purchasing a world pass, a gold world pass or turning in rewards with a referred friend. This packet is used as a response to those various menu options. The packets `Type` value is used to inform the event what kind of response is being handled for the users selected option.

When choosing to purchase either kind of world pass, the following `Type` values are used:

| Type | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `0x00` | _Exits event; displays: `Currently unable to connect to World Pass Center.` message._ |
| `0x01` | _Exits event; displays the clients current active world pass information._ |
| `0x02` | _Exits event; displays: `You do not have enough gil to obtain one.` message._ |
| `0x03` | _Price validation; prompts to user to confirm their purchase. Displays the price of the world pass._ |

_Additional `Type` values higher than `0x03` will all cause the price validation dialog during this state. The server uses `0x03` for this._

When the client chooses 'Yes' to purchase the world pass, then the `Type` value will be used as follows:

| Type | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `0x00` | _Exits event; displays no message._ |
| `0x01` | _Exits event; displays no message._ |
| `0x02` | _Exits event; displays no message._ |
| `0x03` | _Exits event; displays no message._ |
| `0x04` | _Exits event; displays: `You do not have enough gil to obtain one.` message._ |
| `0x05` | _Exits event; displays: `Currently unable to connect to World Pass Center.` message._ |
| `0x06` | _Exits event; displays the clients world pass information._ |

_Additional `Type` values higher than `0x06` will all exit the event with no message._
