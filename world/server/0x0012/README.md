```cpp
// PS2: GP_SERV_GM
struct GP_SERV_GM
{
    uint16_t    id: 9;
    uint16_t    size: 7;
    uint16_t    sync;

    uint8_t     Mes[]; // PS2: Mes
};
```

> This string value is not guaranteed to be null-terminated!

## Additional Information

This packet is used for GM related messaging and is not sent to normal clients. This is not used for normal GM communications with players either, those are sent as normal chat packets (`0x0017`) with a flag set to mark the packet as from a GM. The intended purpose of this packet is unknown, but speculations on what it could be for are:

  - Chat channel that only GM's can see and use.
  - Chat channel that is used for GM ticket system output.

The client simply determines the length of the message based on the packet size then prints it directly to chat using chat mode `0x0A`. This mode value is then converted into type `0xC9` internally.
