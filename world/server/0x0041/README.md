## Description

This packet is sent by the server to populate the clients blacklist.

## Packet Layout

The layout of this packet is the following:

```cpp
// PS2: SAVE_BLACK
struct SAVE_BLACK
{
    uint32_t    ID;         // PS2: ID
    uint8_t     Name[16];   // PS2: Name
};

// PS2: GP_BLACK_LIST
struct GP_BLACK_LIST
{
    uint16_t    id: 9;
    uint16_t    size: 7;
    uint16_t    sync;

    SAVE_BLACK  List[12];   // PS2: List
    int8_t      Stat;       // PS2: Stat
    int8_t      Num;        // PS2: Num
    uint16_t    paddingF6;  // PS2: (New; did not exist.)
};
```

## Packet Fields

The following information describes the structures outlined above.

## Structure Fields (`GP_BLACK_LIST`)

### `id`, `size`, `sync`

_These fields are part of the packet header._

_You can find more information about the header fields here: [**Header**](/world/HEADER.md)_

### `List`

_The list of blacklist entries of this packet._

### `Stat`

_The packets status flags._

The client uses this value to determine the current initialization state of the blacklist and other data. Currently, only two bits are used by the client:

  - `pkt->Stat & 1` - _If set, causes the client to reset the internal `GC_BLK_PTRDATA` linked list nodes, preparing it to be repopulated._
  - `pkt->Stat & 2` - _If set, causes the client to set the blacklist status to `1`, marking it as completed._

### `Num`

_The number of entries populated in the `List` array._

### `paddingF6`

_Padding; unused._

## Structure Fields (`SAVE_BLACK`)

### `ID`

_The blacklisted character server id._

### `Name`

_The blacklisted character name._

## Additional Information

The server uses this packet to populate the clients blacklist. Each client can blacklist up to a total of 300 characters. This packet can only hold up to 12 entries at once, thus multiple packets will be sent if the client has more than 12 entries populated. In order to tell the client of the different states of this packet, it makes use of the `Stat` field.

The first packet of this type sent from the server will have the `Stat` flag `0x01` set. This tells the client to clear out its current blacklist information and prepare itself to be fully repopulated. The last packet of this type sent from the server will have the `Stat` flag `0x02` set. This tells the client that the final blacklist information packet has been received and it can mark the blacklist as fully populated locally.

If the client has no one on their blacklist or has 12 or less entries, then the server can fit all information into a single packet. When this happens, the server will only send a single packet and will set both `0x01` and `0x02` flags for `Stat`.
