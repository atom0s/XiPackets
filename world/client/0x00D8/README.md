## Packet Layout

The layout of this packet is the following:

```cpp
// PS2: (New; did not exist.)
struct packet_t
{
    uint16_t    id: 9;
    uint16_t    size: 7;
    uint16_t    sync;

    uint16_t    ActIndex;
    uint16_t    Param1;
    uint8_t     Param2;
    uint8_t     padding00[3];
    uint32_t    UniqueNo;
    uint8_t     Data[24];
};
```

## Packet Fields

The following information describes the structures outlined above.

## Structure Fields (`packet_t`)

## Additional Information

This packet is used when the client is manipulating a private dungeon related item. This is mainly used with the `Moblin Maze Mongers` content.

_**Note:** There is much more work needed to fully reverse this packet. Due to the nature of content it is involved with; it is considered low priority currently._
