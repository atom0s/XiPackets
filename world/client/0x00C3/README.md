{
    uint16_t    id: 9;
    uint16_t    size: 7;
    uint16_t    sync;

    uint8_t     State;      // PS2: State
    uint8_t     LinkshellId;// PS2: (New; did not exist.)
};
```

The following information describes the structures outlined above.

## Structure Fields (`GP_CLI_GROUP_COMLINK_MAKE`)

### `id`, `size`, `sync`

_These fields are part of the packet header._

_You can find more information about the header fields here: [**Header**](/world/HEADER.md)_

### `State`

_The command state._

The client will default this value to `0`. However, this value does come from the clients input to the given command, such as `/makelinkshell 4`. If this value is anything other than `0`, then it will fail to do anything on the server side.

This value is set to the linkshell id that is having a pearl created for it.

  - `1` - _Linkshell 1_
  - `2` - _Linkshell 2_
