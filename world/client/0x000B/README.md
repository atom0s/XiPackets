## Additional Information

This packet was originally used to tell the server that the client wishes to log out in some manner. There was multiple states in which the client could log out, or be logged out, that are now no longer used. Normal logout requests by the client would set the `State` value to `GP_GAME_LOGOUT_STATE_LOGOUT`.

This packet was also used with a now removed command `/zonechg` which was likely used with GM accounts. This command would allow the client to force-zone themselves to another area and give the initial position the client should be loaded into at upon zoning. This packet is now deprecated and no longer used by the client, however the function that sends this packet still exists and the layout of the packet has not changed since the PS2 beta. When this command was used, the `State` value of this packet was set to `GP_GAME_LOGOUT_STATE_ZONECHANGE`.
