## Description

This packet is sent by the client when updating an event that involves the clients position. _(ie. Requesting to warp between telepoints.)_

## Packet Layout

The layout of this packet is the following:

```cpp
// PS2: GP_CLI_EVENTENDXZY
struct GP_CLI_EVENTENDXZY
{
    uint16_t    id: 9;
    uint16_t    size: 7;
    uint16_t    sync;

    float       x;          // PS2: x
    float       y;          // PS2: y
    float       z;          // PS2: z
    uint32_t    UniqueNo;   // PS2: UniqueNo
    uint32_t    EndPara;    // PS2: EndPara
    uint16_t    EventNum;   // PS2: EventNum
    uint16_t    EventPara;  // PS2: EventPara
    uint16_t    ActIndex;   // PS2: ActIndex
    uint8_t     Mode;       // PS2: Mode
    int8_t      dir;        // PS2: dir
};
```

## Packet Fields

The following information describes the structures outlined above.

## Structure Fields (`GP_CLI_EVENTENDXZY`)

### `id`, `size`, `sync`

_These fields are part of the packet header._

_You can find more information about the header fields here: [**Header**](/world/HEADER.md)_

### `x`

_The local clients X position._

### `y`

_The local clients Y position._

### `z`

_The local clients Z position._

### `UniqueNo`

_The event server id._

This value is set to the clients local `PTR_CliEventUniqueNo` value. This will generally be set to the local clients server id, however it can also be updated by the server with the various event related packets.

### `EndPara`

_The event end parameter._

This value will be set to the value stored in `PTR_Work_Zone[1]`.

### `EventNum`

_The event number._

This value is set to the clients local `PTR_CliEventNum` value.

### `EventPara`

_The event parameter._

This value is set to the clients local `PTR_CliEventPara` value.

### `ActIndex`

_The event target index._

This value is set to the clients local `PTR_CliEventIndex` value. This will generally be set to the local clients target index, however it can also be updated by the server with the various event related packets.

### `Mode`

_The packet mode._

This value is always set to `1`.

### `dir`

_The local clients heading direction._

## Additional Information
