    uint16_t    size: 7;
    uint16_t    sync;

    uint8_t     Kind;       // PS2: (New; did not exist.)
    uint8_t     unknown05;  // PS2: (New; did not exist.)
    uint8_t     sName[15];  // PS2: (New; did not exist.)
    uint8_t     Mes[];      // PS2: (New; did not exist.)

## Additional Information

This packet is used by the client when interacting with the newer Assist channel sub menus and similar related menus, such as the one shown with the newer `/mutelist` command. These new chat channels allow players to help each other while also allowing for self-moderation where players can rate moderators and moderators can warn unhelpful players or even mute them from the assist channels for 24 hours.

There are four sub-commands that can be used with these menus which are the `Kind` values shown above:

  - `Give Thumbs Up` - _Used by players (and mentors) to say thanks to others being helpful._
  - `Issue Warning` - _Used by players (and mentors) to warn unhelpful players._
  - `Add To Mute List` - _Used by mentors to mute others from speaking in the Assist channels for 24 hours._
  - `Remove From Mute List` - _Used by mentors to remove a muted player from the list before the 24 hour period._

To assist with bias as well as to prevent abuse, there are limitations set in place with this system:

  - `Normal Players`
    - May issue a single thumbs up and warning per day.
    - Cannot mute others.
  - `Mentors`
    - May issue multiple thumbs up and warnings per day.
    - May only receive 3 total evaluations per day.
    - Can mute other players. _(Must be rank 6 mentor or above!)_
      - _Mutes must be issued within 10 minutes of the targeted players last message!_
